👋 Hi, I'm Priyadharshini R

🎓 Final-year Computer Science Engineering student
💻 Full-Stack Developer (Python / Java)
📍 Chennai, India

I build and maintain production-grade web applications that solve real business problems. My work spans backend development, system design, and deploying applications that are actively used—not just demos.

🌱 About Me

I’m a developer who learns by shipping real software. I’ve worked closely with non-technical stakeholders, translated business workflows into code, and taken ownership of features from design to deployment.

I care about:

clarity over cleverness

systems that don’t break under real usage

code that can be understood and maintained by others

🧠 Technical Focus

Backend: Python (Django, Flask), Java (Spring Boot), REST APIs

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

Databases: MySQL

Deployment & Tools: Git, GitHub, Postman, PythonAnywhere, basic Docker exposure
